According to the text, **an auto-remediation tool is a tool or system that automatically identifies and fixes issues in a computing environment**. In the context of the passage, the auto-remediation tool mentioned is called "Skynet," and it was designed to monitor, scale, and fix issues in the Cloud infrastructure at SlideShare. The tool utilized a parallel job-execution system (MCollective) to execute commands on one or multiple servers simultaneously. In this specific incident, the tool played a role in restoring the infrastructure after an unintended shutdown caused by a bug in the code. The auto-remediation tool is crucial for efficiently addressing and resolving problems in the system without manual intervention.

There are several auto-remediation tools and frameworks available across different domains. These tools automate the detection and correction of issues to maintain system health. Here are a few examples:

1. **AWS Systems Manager (formerly EC2 Systems Manager):** This service from Amazon Web Services helps you automate operational tasks across your AWS resources. It includes features for patch management, automation workflows, and maintenance tasks.

2. **Ansible Automation Platform:** Ansible is an open-source automation tool that can be used for configuration management, application deployment, task automation, and more. It allows users to define automation playbooks that can be executed to remediate issues automatically.

3. **Chef Automate:** Chef is a configuration management tool that, along with Chef Automate, provides a platform for continuous automation. It helps in managing infrastructure as code and automating the deployment and configuration of systems.

4. **Puppet Remediate:** Puppet is a configuration management tool, and Puppet Remediate is specifically designed for vulnerability remediation. It automates the identification and remediation of vulnerabilities in your infrastructure.

5. **SaltStack:** SaltStack is an open-source infrastructure automation and management platform. It uses a declarative language to define the state of systems, making it suitable for configuration management, remote execution, and auto-remediation.

6. **PagerDuty:** While not a traditional auto-remediation tool, PagerDuty is an incident management platform that integrates with various monitoring and alerting tools. It enables the automatic triggering of responses or remediation actions when incidents are detected.

7. **Datadog:** Datadog is a monitoring and analytics platform that offers features for auto-remediation. It can be integrated with other tools to trigger actions based on predefined conditions or alerts.

8. **RunDeck:** RunDeck is an open-source automation service with a web-based user interface. It allows you to define and run workflows, making it useful for automating operational tasks and remediation.

When implementing auto-remediation, it's important to carefully design and test workflows to avoid unintended consequences. Additionally, the choice of a specific tool may depend on the technology stack and requirements of the infrastructure being managed.
